__与人相处的智慧__

《雅各书》是新约最早成书的一卷，作者是耶稣肉身的亲弟弟，“耶稣爱之奴隶”的雅各，
授书人是分散各地的信耶稣的犹太人，也是写给我们这些在基督里的“真以色列人”。这
卷书，好似新约的《箴言》，又好似是耶稣《登山宝训》的再现。圣灵特别把它选进圣经，
我们不可不信这书里的话。圣灵让《罗马书》启示“因信称义”的真理，圣灵更是让
《雅各书》来检验我们的“活的信心”。

在上次的退休会，神借着《雅各书》第一章，向我们启示，祂定意要在祂的儿女身上，
做成生命的成熟——“成全，完备，毫无缺欠”。为此，这位守约施慈爱神，给我们百般
的试炼，让我们的生命愈加成熟。祂改变我们的眼光，让我们羡慕试炼；祂允许我们
向他求智慧，让我们的忍耐可以完全；祂借着赐下属天的智慧，在我们生命中带下
数不清的祝福。而恩典的结果，是叫我们"好像初熟的果子"，让神得着享受，得着满足。
这真是莫大的荣耀！

这次的特会，我们将一同学习《雅各书》第二和第三章，盼望可以得着“与人相处的
智慧”。愿神借着雅各的话，帮助我们进入生命的实际。给我们一个新的眼光，去重
新认识身边的人；学习跟随信心去生活；学习在言语上受约束，让称义的事实，成就
在我们身上；也让我们在他人眼中“各人都有王子的样式（each one resembled
the sons of a king）”，满有“智慧的温柔”，作人际关系的“赢家”，成为别人
的祝福，把荣耀归于神。

__The Wisdom in Community__

The Epistle of James is the first book to be completed in the
New Testament. It was penned by Jesus’ blood brother, who was
“a slave to His love”, for the edification of Jews diaspora who
believed in Jesus, and to us, the “true Israelites” in Christ.
This book is akin to the Book of Proverbs of the New Testament
and is like a restatement of the Sermon on Mountain. The Holy
Spirit especially incorporated it in the Bible, therefore we must
not disbelieve in the words of this book. He uses the Epistle to
the Romans to reveal the Truth that we are justified through
faith, and the Epistle of James to test whether we have a living
faith.

In our last retreat, God revealed to us through James Chapter 1
that He wills to accomplish the maturity of life in His children:
a life that is " perfect and complete, lacking in nothing." To
this end, God, who keeps His covenant and mercy, has been giving
us “trials of every kind” in order to grow our lives. He changes
out perspective, so that we can long for these trials. He allows
us to seek wisdom from Him, so that our perseverance may be
complete; He blesses us with heavenly wisdom, which brings
innumerable blessings into our lives. The result of this grace is
to make us “like first-fruits”, giving God pleasure and
satisfaction. What a great honor!

In this gathering, we will study the Epistle of James, Chapters 2
through 3. We hope to receive the “Wisdom in Community”. May God
lead us with the words of James to put our Life into practice, and
to gain a new perspective, to see people around us in a new light.
Let us learn to live in faith, to be disciplined in speech, and to
allow the reality of sanctification to be accomplished on us. May
we each “resemble the sons of a king”, full of “meekness of
wisdom”, to be a blessing onto others. Glory be to God!

### Workshop: To Understand and Overcome Addiction
__Speaker: Mark Yu__

Addiction has become an important and even threatening problem
in many countries, societies, schools, and families. From
substance abuse such as tobacco, alcohol, and drug, to
psychological dependence such as pornography, game, gambling, and
chatting etc., addiction is corrupting us, people around us, and
humanity. This workshop includes two parts: The first half focuses
on understanding the root cause of addition and the second part
introduces several principles in regards to fighting addiction,
from a spiritual perspective.

### 探索：衝突
__讲员：李家玮__

衝突，一個我們都不喜歡但是卻又避免不了的事情。我們時常面對衝突，解決衝突，
甚至反省從裡面學到的功課，但是馬上，我們發現又進入了另一個衝突。衝突從
哪裡來?  又把我們帶到哪裡去?  現在的市面上，充滿了講解解決衝突的顧問老師
還有方法，但是真的為我們解決問題了嗎?  這個專題盼望能夠與聽眾一同探索衝突
的起點，進而找到出路，或者一個正確看待它的眼光。

### A Dialog: Conflict
__Speaker: Jeff Lee__

Conflict, a matter in which we hate to deal with but yet cannot escape.
We often face conflicts, resolve them, and even reflect to try to learn
from them.  But soon afterwards, we fall into another conflict.  Where does
conflict come from?  Where will conflict take us to?  The market is filled
with conflict resolution teachings, consulting services, and techniques.
However did they truly solve the problem for us?  This workshop hopes to
discover the source of conflicts so a path forward may be found and even
more so a right perspective may be gained in dealing with it.
