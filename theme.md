## 与人相处的智慧
主题讲员: 刘志雄 长老

主题经文: 雅各书 1－2 章

《雅各书》是新约最早成书的一卷，作者是耶稣肉身的亲弟弟，“耶稣爱之奴隶”的雅各，
授书人是分散各地的信耶稣的犹太人，也是写给我们这些在基督里的“真以色列人”。这
卷书，好似新约的《箴言》，又好似是耶稣《登山宝训》的再现。圣灵特别把它选进圣经，
我们不可不信这书里的话。圣灵让《罗马书》启示“因信称义”的真理，圣灵更是让
《雅各书》来检验我们的“活的信心”。

在上次的退休会，神借着《雅各书》第一章，向我们启示，祂定意要在祂的儿女身上，
做成生命的成熟——“成全，完备，毫无缺欠”。为此，这位守约施慈爱神，给我们百般
的试炼，让我们的生命愈加成熟。祂改变我们的眼光，让我们羡慕试炼；祂允许我们
向他求智慧，让我们的忍耐可以完全；祂借着赐下属天的智慧，在我们生命中带下
数不清的祝福。而恩典的结果，是叫我们"好像初熟的果子"，让神得着享受，得着满足。
这真是莫大的荣耀！

这次的特会，我们将一同学习《雅各书》第二和第三章，盼望可以得着“与人相处的
智慧”。愿神借着雅各的话，帮助我们进入生命的实际。给我们一个新的眼光，去重
新认识身边的人；学习跟随信心去生活；学习在言语上受约束，让称义的事实，成就
在我们身上；也让我们在他人眼中“各人都有王子的样式（each one resembled
the sons of a king）”，满有“智慧的温柔”，作人际关系的“赢家”，成为别人
的祝福，把荣耀归于神。

## The Wisdom in Community
Main Speaker: Peter Liu

Scripture: James 1-2

The Epistle of James is the first book to be completed in the
New Testament. It was penned by Jesus’ blood brother, who was
“a slave to His love”, for the edification of Jews diaspora who
believed in Jesus, and to us, the “true Israelites” in Christ.
This book is akin to the Book of Proverbs of the New Testament
and is like a restatement of the Sermon on Mountain. The Holy
Spirit especially incorporated it in the Bible, therefore we must
not disbelieve in the words of this book. He uses the Epistle to
the Romans to reveal the Truth that we are justified through
faith, and the Epistle of James to test whether we have a living
faith.

In our last retreat, God revealed to us through James Chapter 1
that He wills to accomplish the maturity of life in His children:
a life that is " perfect and complete, lacking in nothing." To
this end, God, who keeps His covenant and mercy, has been giving
us “trials of every kind” in order to grow our lives. He changes
out perspective, so that we can long for these trials. He allows
us to seek wisdom from Him, so that our perseverance may be
complete; He blesses us with heavenly wisdom, which brings
innumerable blessings into our lives. The result of this grace is
to make us “like first-fruits”, giving God pleasure and
satisfaction. What a great honor!

In this gathering, we will study the Epistle of James, Chapters 2
through 3. We hope to receive the “Wisdom in Community”. May God
lead us with the words of James to put our Life into practice, and
to gain a new perspective, to see people around us in a new light.
Let us learn to live in faith, to be disciplined in speech, and to
allow the reality of sanctification to be accomplished on us. May
we each “resemble the sons of a king”, full of “meekness of
wisdom”, to be a blessing onto others. Glory be to God!
