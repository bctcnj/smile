in many countries, societies, schools, and families. From
substance abuse such as tobacco, alcohol, and drug, to
psychological dependence such as pornography, game, gambling, and
chatting etc., addiction is corrupting us, people around us, and
humanity. This workshop includes two parts: The first half focuses

### 探索：衝突
__讲员：李家玮__

衝突，一個我們都不喜歡但是卻又避免不了的事情。我們時常面對衝突，解決衝突，
甚至反省從裡面學到的功課，但是馬上，我們發現又進入了另一個衝突。衝突從
哪裡來?  又把我們帶到哪裡去?  現在的市面上，充滿了講解解決衝突的顧問老師
還有方法，但是真的為我們解決問題了嗎?  這個專題盼望能夠與聽眾一同探索衝突
的起點，進而找到出路，或者一個正確看待它的眼光。

### A Dialog: Conflict
__Speaker: Jeff Lee__

Conflict, a matter in which we hate to deal with but yet cannot escape.
We often face conflicts, resolve them, and even reflect to try to learn
from them.  But soon afterwards, we fall into another conflict.  Where does
conflict come from?  Where will conflict take us to?  The market is filled
with conflict resolution teachings, consulting services, and techniques.
However did they truly solve the problem for us?  This workshop hopes to
discover the source of conflicts so a path forward may be found and even
more so a right perspective may be gained in dealing with it.
